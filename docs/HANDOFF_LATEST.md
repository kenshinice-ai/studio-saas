# PWE Studio v8.0.1 — Current Handoff

Date: 2026-07-29
Baseline: tag `v8.0.0`, commit `abc01ce6e4f281056c3c22fa665e42d7811e0688`
Release branch: `codex/v8.0.1-product-home-brand-release`
Release source of truth: `VERSION`, final `main` commit and annotated tag `v8.0.1`
Post-release corrective branch: `codex/super-admin-tunnel-chain-fix`

## 0. AWS production is LIVE (2026-07-30)

`https://pwestudio.online` serves v8.0.1 from AWS Lightsail. **The Cloudflare
Tunnel is no longer the production path** and must not be reintroduced for this
hostname: the tunnel existed because the runtime had no public IP. With a static
Lightsail IP and Route 53 delegation, a tunnel would add a third-party hop, a
second credential to rotate, and would compete with certbot HTTP-01 for the
same hostname.

| Item | Truth |
|---|---|
| Instance | Lightsail `PWESTUDIO`, Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64, 2 vCPU / 1.9 GB / 58 GB, Sydney Zone A |
| Static IP | `13.237.190.58` |
| DNS | Route 53; `pwestudio.online` and `www.pwestudio.online` both A → the static IP |
| Edge | host nginx terminates TLS; app listens on `127.0.0.1:8899` only; 80 → 443; HSTS `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` |
| Certificate | Let's Encrypt, SAN = apex + www, lineage `pwestudio.online`, expires 2026-10-28, `certbot.timer` active |
| Runtime | Compose project `pwestudio`: `studiosaas:8.0.1` (commit `cdd204e`) + `postgres:16-alpine`, both healthy |
| Database | 6 tenants / 15 users / 65 students / 37 registrations / 81 media assets / 4276 audit rows; 20 migrations |
| Least privilege | migrations use the owner role inside entrypoint only; runtime uses `studiosaas_app` |
| Backups | `/etc/cron.d/pwestudio-backup` 03:15 UTC → logical dump + volume tarball; restore rehearsal passes |
| Release layout | `/opt/pwestudio/releases/PWE-StudioSaaS-aws-8.0.1-cdd204e`, `current` symlink, env at `/opt/pwestudio/shared/production.env` (600) |
| Canonical host | `www` 301s to the apex over TLS; one origin, no duplicate content |
| Operator entry | `ssh pwestudio` (see §0.2) and `bash deploy/aws/pwestudio_remote.sh <cmd>` |
| Not yet done | RDS, S3, SES, MFA for privileged accounts, off-box backup copy, uptime monitoring |

### 0.1 "Not Secure" in Chrome was a client-side cache, not a server fault

Measured from outside on 2026-07-30 after the edge went up:

```
http://pwestudio.online/   -> 301 -> https://pwestudio.online/   (1 redirect)
ssl_verify_result = 0      certificate chain = 4 certs, Verification: OK
homepage absolute http:// references = 0   (CSP is default-src 'self', so
                                            mixed content is structurally
                                            impossible, not merely absent)
```

Chrome had cached the HTTP 200 from before TLS existed and kept loading over
HTTP without re-following the new 301. Visiting `https://` once takes the HSTS
header, after which the browser refuses HTTP for a year. Nothing to fix
server-side. If it recurs on a device: hard-reload, or clear the site's data.

Optional permanent hardening not done: submitting the domain to the HSTS
preload list would make browsers refuse HTTP even before a first visit. It is a
one-way door — the domain must then always serve HTTPS — so it is a decision to
take deliberately, not a side effect of a deployment round.

### 0.2 Operating the instance

Access is an `ssh_config` alias; the key is **not** in the repository or in
iCloud. The private key was moved out of the synced project folder — iCloud
cannot hold mode 600, and a synced private key is a copy you do not control:

```
~/.ssh/pwestudio-lightsail.pem        mode 600   (byte-identical to the
                                                  Lightsail default key)
~/.ssh/config      Host pwestudio -> 13.237.190.58, user ubuntu
```

`deploy/aws/pwestudio_remote.sh` is the laptop-side half. It holds no
credentials and delegates everything that touches production data to
`lightsail_ctl.sh` on the instance, so a laptop is never the source of truth
for a production procedure:

```bash
bash deploy/aws/pwestudio_remote.sh status     # containers + deep health
bash deploy/aws/pwestudio_remote.sh health     # public HTTPS, DNS, cert, redirect
bash deploy/aws/pwestudio_remote.sh backups    # what is on disk, and the cron log
bash deploy/aws/pwestudio_remote.sh backup     # dump + volume tarball, now
bash deploy/aws/pwestudio_remote.sh drill      # rehearse a restore (safe)
bash deploy/aws/pwestudio_remote.sh certs      # expiry + renew timer
bash deploy/aws/pwestudio_remote.sh deploy dist/PWE-StudioSaaS-aws-<ver>.tar.gz
bash deploy/aws/pwestudio_remote.sh ssh
```

`deploy` refuses a `mode=standalone` tarball before uploading it, backs up
first, and **rolls the `current` symlink back automatically if deep health
fails**. Commands that remove a volume, drop a database, or perform a real
restore are deliberately absent — those live on the instance where the operator
reads the confirmation prompt in context.

### 0.3 Edge hardening (2026-07-30, second pass)

- **One shared TLS snippet** (`deploy/aws/nginx/pwestudio-tls.conf`, installed to
  `/etc/nginx/snippets/`) included by both 443 blocks. A hardened apex beside a
  default-configured `www` block is a downgrade path hiding in plain sight.
  TLS 1.2 is limited to forward-secret AEAD suites; no CBC, no RSA key exchange,
  no 3DES. Session cache on, tickets off.
- **OCSP stapling is deliberately OFF.** Every hardening guide says to enable it;
  it is now dead configuration for Let's Encrypt. The certificate's AIA carries
  only `CA Issuers - URI:http://ye1.i.lencr.org/` and no OCSP responder URL, so
  nginx accepts `ssl_stapling on` and then logs `"ssl_stapling" ignored` on
  every reload — a permanent warning that trains an operator to stop reading
  reload output, which is where real errors appear. Re-check after any renewal:
  `openssl s_client ... | openssl x509 -noout -ocsp_uri` should print nothing.
- **No duplicate security headers.** `backend/server.py:777-796` already sends a
  complete CSP, X-Frame-Options, Permissions-Policy, Referrer-Policy and
  X-Content-Type-Options. nginx was repeating two of them. HSTS stays at the
  edge on purpose: it must also cover responses the application never produced,
  and nginx's 502 while the container restarts is exactly when a downgrade must
  not be on offer.
- **Branded maintenance page** for 502/503/504 (`/var/www/pwestudio/__maintenance.html`,
  `internal`, no-store, `Retry-After: 30`). An upgrade restarts the container for
  a few seconds; nginx's stock "502 Bad Gateway" reads like the studio's website
  is broken rather than briefly updating.
- **nginx 1.24 constraint**: HTTP/2 is a `listen` parameter on Ubuntu 24.04. The
  1.25+ `http2 on;` directive fails `nginx -t` — caught by the config test
  before reload, so the live site was never affected.

Nine contract tests in `backend/tests/test_lightsail_deployment.py` hold all of
the above, including that the operator script carries no credentials and cannot
destroy anything.

### Four defects this deployment round found and fixed

All four looked fine from the outside and would have surfaced only during an
incident:

1. **Daily backups had never once succeeded.** `lightsail_ctl.sh` invoked
   `scripts/backup_postgres.py`, but the script is at `backend/scripts/` inside
   the image (WORKDIR `/app`). Nothing read the cron output.
2. **Even with the right path, the dump could not be written.** The bind-mounted
   backup directory was `ubuntu:ubuntu 0755` while the container runs as uid
   10001 → `Permission denied`. Now owner uid 10001, group the operator, mode
   2750, asserted on every run so a human can also list backups without sudo.
3. **The restore rehearsal could never pass.** The image installed an unpinned
   `postgresql-client`, resolving to 17, against a PostgreSQL 16 server; a 17
   `pg_restore` emits `SET transaction_timeout = 0`, a PG17-only GUC, which
   PG16 rejects. The client is now pinned to `postgresql-client-16` from PGDG.
   Dumps produced by the 17 client were deleted — a 16 client cannot read them,
   so keeping them would hand an operator an unusable backup mid-incident.
4. **The media volume was empty.** The database referenced 81 media assets and
   160 derivatives; the volume held only Linux's stock `/media/{cdrom,floppy,usb}`
   from the image layer. Every brand logo returned 404. The 2032-file media tree
   was extracted with uid 10001 ownership, and `backfill_media_variants.py` was
   fixed to verify that a derivative's **file** exists rather than only its row
   — it previously reported "Generated variants: 0" while 126 files were missing.

## 1. Historical delivery boundary (pre-2026-07-30)

v8.0.1 was first shipped as a verified local release and customer-demonstration
package, before the AWS deployment above.

| Area | Truth at the time |
|---|---|
| SaaS runtime | Local Waitress + PostgreSQL behind the controlled `studiosaas-v8-controlled` Cloudflare Tunnel |
| Public product URL | `https://studiosaas.cc.cd` reported v8.0.1 from the same runtime as `http://127.0.0.1:8901` |
| Role entry contract | `/platform-admin` = platform control plane; `/studio-admin` = neutral tenant-admin login; `/cms` = neutral tenant-operations login |
| AWS/RDS/S3/SES | Not purchased or deployed *(Lightsail now deployed; RDS/S3/SES still not)* |
| Production backups/restore/monitoring/SLA | Deferred *(backups + restore rehearsal now live; monitoring/SLA still deferred)* |
| Online payment, provider SMS/email, custom domains | Deferred |
| Multi-campus | One campus = one tenant/subscription; future organisation aggregation is deferred |

Do not describe local testing, a source bundle or Cloudflare invitation access
as production acceptance. Production acceptance is `https://pwestudio.online`
answering deep health with `appVersion=8.0.1`, `mode=saas`, `db=ok` — see §0.

## 2. What v8.0.1 delivers

### P0 — customer-safe demonstration and commercial readiness

- SaaS `/` is a bilingual product gateway with a clear product story, five
  role entrances, sales journey, plans, migration downloads and support CTA.
- v8.0.1 brings that gateway onto the canonical PWE family palette: Family
  Navy `#0E1729`, Family Amber `#F5B335`, accessible amber text `#A16207` and
  Warm Paper `#F7F5F2`. Retired forest, sage and coral values are rejected by
  a dedicated regression test.
- The gateway now follows the approved sales story—administration behind the
  scenes, creativity in front—uses Let’s Paint Studio as the demonstration
  proof, identifies Studio at AUD 99/month as the recommended plan and
  discloses the AUD 299–999 setup range.
- `lets-paint-showcase` is the only professional demonstration tenant. It uses
  fictional people/contact records and synthetic artwork.
- `RESET_DEMO_TENANT.command` and
  `backend/scripts/reset_professional_demo.py`:
  - refuse standalone mode;
  - require the exact phrase `RESET-LETS-PAINT-SHOWCASE`;
  - can only touch the permanently marked `lets-paint-showcase` tenant;
  - keep four staff roles on the configured stable local/Pilot password and
    rotate the separate student code on every reset;
  - write credentials to `.runtime/credentials/showcase-credentials.txt` as
    mode `0600`, never to stdout.
- `docs/customer/` contains a customer-readable delivery index, pricing and
  package boundaries, service agreement draft, onboarding checklist, FAQ,
  migration guide, support policy, integration boundary, multi-campus policy,
  security/privacy/compliance disclosure, demonstration runbook and release
  evidence.
- Security/compliance material explicitly discloses the pre-production state,
  privileged MFA gap, backup gate and incident-response boundary.

### P1 — connected operating experience

- Studio Admin remains the website/brand workspace and CMS remains daily
  operations; both now provide stable reciprocal navigation.
- Onboarding is documented from commercial discovery through tenant creation,
  brand publishing, operational rehearsal, migration and acceptance.
- Reviewed CSV and five-sheet XLSX templates define the supported migration
  shape. Arbitrary historic spreadsheets require assessment and may require
  separately quoted clean-up.
- Family private access shows balance, next class, attendance and portfolio,
  then opens tenant-addressed device Messages/Mail actions for schedule or
  absence enquiries.
- Active recurring schedules download as a tenant-timezone ICS file with stable
  UIDs and weekly recurrence. The export contains no roster/student data.
- Teacher mobile mode prioritises three steps: today's roster, student lookup
  and artwork upload. Non-financial roles see attendance KPIs, not revenue
  labels with zeroed values.
- Product-home Support & Feedback opens the device Mail/Messages application;
  there is no claim of automated delivery, delivery log or retry.

### P2 — sales story and deliberate extension points

- The demonstration runbook follows Let’s Paint Studio from enquiry → trial →
  enrolment → recurring schedule → attendance/credit → artwork → family view →
  owner report.
- Eight industry presets now include three bilingual starter courses,
  registration focus, report focus and a demonstration story in addition to
  industry terminology and visual themes.
- v8.0.1 supports CSV/XLSX export/import templates, ICS and device-native
  messaging. Stripe, Xero, Google/Outlook APIs, provider SMS/email and webhooks
  remain explicit extension points.
- Organisation-level multi-campus aggregation is not modelled prematurely;
  campus tenants remain isolated for permissions, billing and operations.

## 3. Demonstration data evidence

The guarded reset was run twice successfully.

| Tenant | Students | Courses | Packages | Schedules | Memberships | Credit balance |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `lets-paint-showcase` | 12 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 78 |
| `lets-paint-studio` | 43 | 3 | 5 | 0 | 1 | 165 |

`lets-paint-studio` retained its pre-reset counts and balance. The showcase
also contains five enquiry states, three private portfolio works and six
metadata-sanitised display/thumbnail variants.

## 4. Verification evidence

### Repository and database gates

- `backend/tests`: **182 passed, 2 skipped**.
- Legacy CMS smoke: **73 passed, 0 failed**.
- PostgreSQL tenant isolation/privacy/Edition suite: **216 passed, 0 failed**.
- Migration check: current.
- Media derivative check: current.
- Python compile, inline scripts, shared JS, CMS source/build consistency, UI
  escaping, terminology and release/Edition shell syntax: passed.
- `STUDIOSAAS_REQUIRE_POSTGRES=1 bash backend/scripts/verify_local.sh`: passed.

### Browser acceptance

Real Chrome, no page errors and no HTTP 5xx:

| Surface | Viewport | Result |
|---|---:|---|
| Product home | 375×812 | no overflow; 44px actions; skip link; language switch; reduced motion; 125% text |
| Product home | 812×375 | no overflow |
| Product home | 768×1024 | no overflow |
| Product home | 1024×768 | no overflow |
| Product home | 1440×900 | no overflow |
| Studio Admin | 1024×900 | 8 industry cards + 8 operational starter-course summaries |
| Owner CMS | 768×1024 | no overflow; authenticated ICS download |
| Teacher CMS | 375×812 | three-step flow; no financial label; no schedule mutation |
| Family private area | 375×812 | balance 8, four attendance rows, one private work, native contact actions |

The post-release tunnel correction was also accepted in the in-app browser
against the public hostname. `/platform-admin` remained on the direct
application login, `/studio-admin` required an explicit slug without browser
storage fallback, `/cms` exposed an explicit tenant selector, and
`/lets-paint-showcase/studio-admin` locked the correct slug. The showcase CMS
rendered the Let's Paint Studio login and no tested page had horizontal
overflow.

Product-home display images are 760×760 WebP with intrinsic dimensions and
total **229,582 bytes** in the browser. Five role entrances render at every
tested viewport; local page load during the acceptance run was approximately
0.56 seconds.

The v8.0.1 product-home pass also verified the computed Navy hero, Warm Paper
canvas, accessible amber text, bilingual sales copy, every visible 44px target,
125% text and reduced-motion behavior. Measured contrast includes 17.90:1 for
white on Navy and 4.52:1 for amber text on Warm Paper.

The ICS response contains three recurring events, `TZID=Australia/Melbourne`,
stable weekly recurrence and no tested student name, mobile or family email.

### Migration artifacts

- `customer-resources/PWE_Studio_Data_Import_Template.csv`
- `customer-resources/PWE_Studio_Data_Import_Template.xlsx`

The XLSX contains Instructions, Students, Courses, Packages and Field Guide
sheets. All five sheets were rendered and visually inspected; ZIP integrity
and spreadsheet error-token scans passed.

## 5. Cloudflare operating truth (LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY as of 2026-07-30)

> **The tunnel is no longer the production path.** `https://pwestudio.online`
> serves production from Lightsail with nginx terminating TLS (§0). Everything
> below now describes the *local* runtime and the `studiosaas.cc.cd` demo
> hostname only. Do not point production DNS at a tunnel, and do not treat
> tunnel parity as production acceptance.
>
> Why no tunnel in production: the tunnel existed because the runtime lived on a
> home Mac with no public IP. A Lightsail static IP plus Route 53 removes that
> constraint, so a tunnel would add a third-party hop and a second credential to
> rotate in front of production, for nothing.


`START_STUDIOSAAS_ONLINE.command` now:

- pins `STUDIOSAAS_MODE=saas`;
- defaults the application runtime to port `8901`;
- reads the expected application version from `VERSION`;
- supports an explicit public base domain;
- resolves environment, logs, CMS data, PID files and Tunnel credentials from
  the project-local, Git-ignored `.runtime/` directory;
- never reads `~/.studiosaas`, `~/.cloudflared` or `/private/tmp` for runtime
  files and never resets application passwords during startup;
- uses the explicit project-local Tunnel credential JSON and configured Tunnel
  name instead of selecting an arbitrary credential;
- waits for local and public health;
- runs `backend/scripts/verify_tunnel_parity.py` against deep health;
- refuses to call the tunnel accepted when version, mode, database or release
  identity differs.

Current observation on 2026-07-29:

- local and public deep health agree on
  `appVersion=8.0.1`, `mode=saas`, `db=ok`;
- DNS for `studiosaas.cc.cd` points to the controlled
  `studiosaas-v8-controlled` tunnel, whose ingress targets
  `http://localhost:8901`;
- the public platform-admin API returned all six local tenants;
- `lets-paint-showcase` owner authentication, tenant API and brand workspace
  all returned the exact showcase tenant;
- `/super-admin` remains a Cloudflare Access-protected compatibility alias;
  `/platform-admin` is the direct application-login route;
- the old tunnel was left intact but is no longer the hostname route, preserving
  rollback without allowing two runtimes to answer the same hostname.
- moving a runtime-complete copy to a path containing spaces and starting from
  that new location passed local health, public health and release parity; the
  15-user password-hash fingerprint was unchanged across restart.

The previous split-brain state is therefore resolved. Do not change the DNS
route back to the historical tunnel or start a second connector with a
different ingress for this hostname.

## 6. Packages and release closure

The clean-commit package gate passed for both delivery modes:

```bash
bash deploy/aws/verify_release_bundles.sh
```

Verified outputs:

- `dist/PWE-StudioSaaS-aws-8.0.1.tar.gz`
- `dist/PWE-Studio-Edition-8.0.1.tar.gz`
- matching `.sha256` sidecars.

The SaaS package includes the product gateway, customer resources,
professional showcase workspace/assets and guarded reset. The Edition package
excludes the showcase workspace and reset command while retaining the shared
runtime and customer/operator documentation. Both archives passed SHA-256,
entrypoint, forbidden-content and `BUILD_INFO` checks. The `.sha256` sidecars
generated from the final tagged commit are the authoritative hashes.

## 7. Operator commands

Production commands are in §0.2. The list below is the **local development**
set; running the tunnel parity check against production is meaningless because
production does not use a tunnel.

```bash
# Local service
bash START_STUDIOSAAS_LOCAL.command

# Guarded professional showcase reset
./RESET_DEMO_TENANT.command

# PostgreSQL-required release gate
STUDIOSAAS_REQUIRE_POSTGRES=1 \
STUDIOSAAS_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://$(whoami)@localhost:5432/studiosaas_local_test \
bash backend/scripts/verify_local.sh

# Tunnel split-brain/version parity
.venv/bin/python backend/scripts/verify_tunnel_parity.py \
  --local-base-url http://localhost:8901 \
  --public-base-url https://studiosaas.cc.cd \
  --expected-app-version 8.0.1 \
  --expected-mode saas

# Clean-commit SaaS + Edition bundles
bash deploy/aws/verify_release_bundles.sh
```

Presenter credentials are intentionally excluded from Git, bundles, docs and
this handoff. Read the protected local file only when presenting.

## 8. Customer-facing compliance pages and brand repair (2026-07-30)

### 8.1 What was wrong

The product gateway footer links two pages that the brand migration missed
entirely. `customer-resources/FAQ.html` and `Release_Notes_v8.0.1.html` still
declared the **retired** palette inline — forest `#15312e` on `#f7f3eb`, a sage
`#dce9df` note band, a `#d7a93d` focus ring.

Root cause of the miss: `backend/tests/test_product_home_brand.py:7` only ever
loaded `product-home.html`. Nothing in `customer-resources/` was inside the
regression net, so the two pages kept an obsolete palette without a single test
failing.

The FAQ was also **factually wrong after today's launch**. It answered "Is this
already a production AWS deployment?" with "No. The current service runs locally
… exposed through Cloudflare Tunnel. AWS hosting, production backups, restore
testing … are pending." All of that is stale as of §0.

### 8.2 What changed

- Both pages re-based on the canonical tokens through a shared
  `backend/frontend/assets/customer-resources.{css,js}`, so the next brand
  change touches one file rather than four.
- FAQ and release notes rewritten against the facts in §0. Deliberately **not**
  over-corrected: monitoring, an SLA, privileged-account MFA and off-box media
  backup are still absent and are still disclosed as absent.
- Two new compliance pages, bilingual on the same `data-lang` mechanism as the
  gateway:
  - `customer-resources/Privacy_Policy.html`
  - `customer-resources/Terms_of_Service.html`
- `product-home.html` footer links both; `backend/server.py` allow-lists both.

### 8.3 Legal identity (owner-supplied, 2026-07-30)

```
PWE GROUP PTY LTD
ABN 55 606 664 546        ACN 606 664 546
Caulfield North, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia
lee.liu.melbourne@gmail.com      Privacy contact: Lee L
Governing law: Victoria, Australia
```

The ABN checksum verifies (weighted sum 534, `534 mod 89 = 0`) and the ACN it
implies verifies independently (check digit 6). **Format and checksum only —
registration status was not looked up**, so neither page asserts more than the
identity itself.

### 8.4 Still open before these pages are relied on

| | Item | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 🟠 | Deliverable postal address | Suburb-level only. A privacy policy normally needs an address that can receive a written access/correction request. Nothing was invented. |
| 🟠 | Domain mailbox | `pwestudio.online` has **no MX record** — `info@` cannot receive mail, which is why the owner's Gmail is published instead. Move to `privacy@pwestudio.online` once MX exists. |
| 🔴 | Australian legal review | Two sections carry `Needs legal review` on the page itself: retention of children's teaching records, and how a deletion request interacts with record-keeping duties. The studios teach children; this is not a wording preference. |
| 🟠 | Liability and insurance | `Terms_of_Service.html:126` marks the cap, indirect-loss exclusion and insurance requirements as intentionally unresolved. |

Both pages carry a draft qualifier at the top, matching how
`docs/customer/Service_Agreement_Draft.md` positions itself.

### 8.5 The regression net that was missing

`backend/tests/test_customer_resources_brand.py` (new, 17 tests) now covers
**every** page in `customer-resources/`, not one hand-picked file:

- retired palette values fail the build; canonical tokens must be present
- no page may declare its own palette instead of reading the shared asset
- bilingual `data-lang` coverage, no leftover `{{PLACEHOLDER}}`
- legal entity present on the compliance pages, draft qualifier present
- the privacy policy must cover children and publication consent, must disclose
  the open gaps, and **must not promise a response deadline** while the
  contact channel is a personal mailbox
- the FAQ must state the live deployment, not the retired boundary
- Family Amber `#F5B335` may never be used as text on a light surface — that is
  what the accessible `#A16207` exists for
- the gateway footer must link every page, and `server.py` must allow-list every
  page shipped

Verification: **242 pytest** (was 206) + terminology, escaping and inline-script
checks all green.

### 8.6 UI/UX upgrade plan

`docs/design/UI_UX_Upgrade_Plan_2026-07-30.md` (1,593 lines) — analysis only,
no code changed by it. Highest-priority finding, which is a live defect rather
than a polish item: `tenant-template/index.html:265` `.result-card` hard-codes
`color:#EFE9DD` against `background:var(--ink)`. Under a light theme that is
13.69:1; under a dark theme `--ink` becomes the light text colour and the
registration success card renders at **1.06:1 — invisible**. The 56px check mark
sits at 1.21:1 and the "back to home" control at :538 has the same problem.

---

## 9. Commercial plan quota revision (2026-07-30, owner decision)

Quotas only. **Prices, plan codes, plan names and feature flags are unchanged**
(Starter 49 / Studio 99 / Growth 199 AUD per month; one-off Setup fee AUD
299–999 also unchanged).

| Plan | AUD/month | Students | Team users | Storage | `storage_limit_mb` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Starter | 49 (unchanged) | 100 (unchanged) | 2 → **1** | 5 GB → **2 GB** | 5120 → **2048** |
| Studio | 99 (unchanged) | 500 (unchanged) | 8 → **5** | 30 GB → **10 GB** | 30720 → **10240** |
| Growth | 199 (unchanged) | 1500 → **1000** | **20 (unchanged)** | 100 GB → **50 GB** | 102400 → **51200** |

`growth.user_limit` stays at **20**: the owner revised only Growth's storage
allowance and student ceiling and did not specify a team-account figure, so the
existing value was preserved rather than invented.

### 9.1 Files changed

Database / seeds:

- `backend/db/migrations/0021_plan_quota_revision.sql` — **new**, idempotent
  quota UPDATEs scoped by plan code (the pending production change, see §8.2).
- `backend/db/schema_v1.sql` and `backend/db/migrations/0001_schema_v1.sql` —
  baseline `INSERT INTO plans` seed rows carry the new quotas, so a fresh
  bootstrap is already correct and 0021 is a no-op there. Both stay in sync per
  the migration discipline.
- `backend/scripts/seed_local_test_tenants.py` — the isolation-fixture `studio`
  plan row now seeds `5, 10240`.
- `backend/test_tenant_isolation.py` — the storage-quota check restores
  `studio.storage_limit_mb` to `10240` instead of `30720` after temporarily
  forcing it to 1 MB.

No new tables, so `backend/studiosaas/services/tenant_archive.py`
`SNAPSHOT_TABLES` is **verified unchanged** — `plans` is a platform-global
table and was never a tenant-scoped snapshot member.

Customer-facing surfaces:

- `product-home.html` — the three public pricing cards, both `en` and `zh`
  spans (Starter "1 team user / 1 个团队账号" is singular).
- `docs/customer/Pricing_and_Package_Boundaries.md` — subscription catalogue.
- `docs/StudioSaaS_Blueprint_v2.md` — plan table.
- `docs/sales/PWE_Studio_销售介绍.pptx` (**current deck**, referenced by
  `README.md` and `docs/sales/talk_track.md`) and
  `docs/sales/PWE_StudioSaaS_销售介绍.pptx` (superseded earlier copy still in
  the repo) — slide 11 pricing table only. Both decks were rewritten
  part-by-part so that `ppt/slides/slide11.xml` is the **only** changed entry
  of 97; `scripts/office/validate.py --original` passes and a LibreOffice
  render of slide 11 before/after shows identical layout with no overflow.

Migration-inventory references bumped 0020 → 0021: `docs/Database.md` (with a
new 0021 paragraph), `docs/Architecture.md`, `docs/Development_Roadmap.md`,
`README.md`.

### 9.2 Pending production change — SQL only, NOT applied

`pwestudio.online` still holds the old catalogue. Editing the repository seed
does not touch a running database. Two ways in, neither performed here:

1. **Preferred — normal deploy.** `deploy/aws/entrypoint.sh` runs
   `scripts/run_migrations.py` with the owner role on every container start, so
   0021 applies by itself with the next
   `bash deploy/aws/pwestudio_remote.sh deploy <tarball>` once the bundle
   contains it. `schema_migrations` gains
   `0021_plan_quota_revision.sql` and the instance moves from 20 to 21 applied
   migrations (the §0 table still records the measured 20).
2. **Quota-only, without a redeploy.** Run the migration body by hand as the
   owner role, then insert the ledger row so the next deploy does not re-run it:

```sql
BEGIN;

UPDATE plans SET user_limit = 1, storage_limit_mb = 2048
 WHERE code = 'starter' AND (user_limit <> 1 OR storage_limit_mb <> 2048);

UPDATE plans SET user_limit = 5, storage_limit_mb = 10240
 WHERE code = 'studio' AND (user_limit <> 5 OR storage_limit_mb <> 10240);

UPDATE plans SET student_limit = 1000, storage_limit_mb = 51200
 WHERE code = 'growth' AND (student_limit <> 1000 OR storage_limit_mb <> 51200);

INSERT INTO schema_migrations (version)
VALUES ('0021_plan_quota_revision.sql')
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

COMMIT;
```

Verify afterwards:

```sql
SELECT code, monthly_price_aud, student_limit, user_limit, storage_limit_mb
  FROM plans WHERE code IN ('starter','studio','growth')
 ORDER BY monthly_price_aud;
-- expect: starter 49/100/1/2048, studio 99/500/5/10240, growth 199/1000/20/51200
```

### 9.3 Safety review of the reduction

1. **Over-quota behaviour is refuse-to-add, never delete.** Three enforcement
   points, all admission control on a *new* record:
   `api_v1._student_capacity` + its two call sites (student create, registration
   conversion) return 403 when `current >= student_limit`; the team
   create/reactivate paths return 403 when active non-`parent` memberships
   `>= user_limit`; `services/media._assert_storage_quota` raises
   `MediaQuotaExceededError` before an upload is written. Nothing archives,
   truncates or deletes existing students, members or media, so a tenant found
   above a lowered ceiling keeps all of its data and simply cannot grow until
   the plan is upgraded.
2. **`lets-play-piano` sits exactly at the new Starter ceiling** (1 of 1 team
   accounts). It keeps working; it cannot add a second account. The refusal
   text is explicit rather than a bare 403 body:
   `User limit reached (1). Upgrade the plan before adding another team member.`
   — plan name, the actual number and the required remedy. The student-side
   equivalents read `Student limit reached (N). Ask the StudioSaaS
   administrator to upgrade the plan.` and `… Upgrade the plan before
   converting this registration.`
3. **`isolation-no-portfolio` (price 1) exists in the production `plans`
   table.** It is the `backend/test_tenant_isolation.py` fixture plan
   (`500 / 8 / 1024 MB`, portfolio flag off) that leaked into the production
   database — reported, deliberately **not** deleted and deliberately **not**
   re-quoted by 0021, which is scoped to the three real plan codes. Cleaning it
   up is a separate decision because a tenant row may still reference it.

Known cosmetic non-issue, **not changed**: `super-admin.html
formatStorageMb()` prints one decimal below 10240 MB, so the Starter quota
renders as "2.0 GB" where the pricing page says "2 GB" (previously "5.0 GB"
vs "5 GB" — same pre-existing behaviour, not a regression). The decimal is
load-bearing for *used*-storage display, so the formatter was left alone. The
"Add Plan" form defaults (`149 / 800 / 12 / 51200`) describe a hypothetical new
custom plan, not Starter/Studio/Growth, and were also left alone.
