# PWE Studio v8.0.1 — Current Handoff

Date: 2026-07-29
Baseline: tag `v8.0.0`, commit `abc01ce6e4f281056c3c22fa665e42d7811e0688`
Release branch: `codex/v8.0.1-product-home-brand-release`
Release source of truth: `VERSION`, final `main` commit and annotated tag `v8.0.1`
Post-release corrective branch: `codex/super-admin-tunnel-chain-fix`

## 1. Delivery boundary

v8.0.1 is a verified local release and customer-demonstration package. It is
not an AWS production deployment.

| Area | Current truth |
|---|---|
| SaaS runtime | Local Waitress + PostgreSQL behind the controlled `studiosaas-v8-controlled` Cloudflare Tunnel |
| Public product URL | `https://studiosaas.cc.cd` reports v8.0.1 from the same runtime as `http://127.0.0.1:8901` |
| Role entry contract | `/platform-admin` = platform control plane; `/studio-admin` = neutral tenant-admin login; `/cms` = neutral tenant-operations login |
| AWS/RDS/S3/SES | Not purchased or deployed |
| Production backups/restore/monitoring/SLA | Deferred until AWS resources exist and a production rehearsal passes |
| Online payment, provider SMS/email, custom domains | Deferred |
| Multi-campus | One campus = one tenant/subscription; future organisation aggregation is deferred |

Do not describe local testing, a source bundle or Cloudflare invitation access
as production acceptance.

## 2. What v8.0.1 delivers

### P0 — customer-safe demonstration and commercial readiness

- SaaS `/` is a bilingual product gateway with a clear product story, five
  role entrances, sales journey, plans, migration downloads and support CTA.
- v8.0.1 brings that gateway onto the canonical PWE family palette: Family
  Navy `#0E1729`, Family Amber `#F5B335`, accessible amber text `#A16207` and
  Warm Paper `#F7F5F2`. Retired forest, sage and coral values are rejected by
  a dedicated regression test.
- The gateway now follows the approved sales story—administration behind the
  scenes, creativity in front—uses Let’s Paint Studio as the demonstration
  proof, identifies Studio at AUD 99/month as the recommended plan and
  discloses the AUD 299–999 setup range.
- `lets-paint-showcase` is the only professional demonstration tenant. It uses
  fictional people/contact records and synthetic artwork.
- `RESET_DEMO_TENANT.command` and
  `backend/scripts/reset_professional_demo.py`:
  - refuse standalone mode;
  - require the exact phrase `RESET-LETS-PAINT-SHOWCASE`;
  - can only touch the permanently marked `lets-paint-showcase` tenant;
  - rotate four role passwords and one student code on every run;
  - write credentials to `~/.studiosaas/showcase-credentials.txt` as mode
    `0600`, never to stdout.
- `docs/customer/` contains a customer-readable delivery index, pricing and
  package boundaries, service agreement draft, onboarding checklist, FAQ,
  migration guide, support policy, integration boundary, multi-campus policy,
  security/privacy/compliance disclosure, demonstration runbook and release
  evidence.
- Security/compliance material explicitly discloses the pre-production state,
  privileged MFA gap, backup gate and incident-response boundary.

### P1 — connected operating experience

- Studio Admin remains the website/brand workspace and CMS remains daily
  operations; both now provide stable reciprocal navigation.
- Onboarding is documented from commercial discovery through tenant creation,
  brand publishing, operational rehearsal, migration and acceptance.
- Reviewed CSV and five-sheet XLSX templates define the supported migration
  shape. Arbitrary historic spreadsheets require assessment and may require
  separately quoted clean-up.
- Family private access shows balance, next class, attendance and portfolio,
  then opens tenant-addressed device Messages/Mail actions for schedule or
  absence enquiries.
- Active recurring schedules download as a tenant-timezone ICS file with stable
  UIDs and weekly recurrence. The export contains no roster/student data.
- Teacher mobile mode prioritises three steps: today's roster, student lookup
  and artwork upload. Non-financial roles see attendance KPIs, not revenue
  labels with zeroed values.
- Product-home Support & Feedback opens the device Mail/Messages application;
  there is no claim of automated delivery, delivery log or retry.

### P2 — sales story and deliberate extension points

- The demonstration runbook follows Let’s Paint Studio from enquiry → trial →
  enrolment → recurring schedule → attendance/credit → artwork → family view →
  owner report.
- Eight industry presets now include three bilingual starter courses,
  registration focus, report focus and a demonstration story in addition to
  industry terminology and visual themes.
- v8.0.1 supports CSV/XLSX export/import templates, ICS and device-native
  messaging. Stripe, Xero, Google/Outlook APIs, provider SMS/email and webhooks
  remain explicit extension points.
- Organisation-level multi-campus aggregation is not modelled prematurely;
  campus tenants remain isolated for permissions, billing and operations.

## 3. Demonstration data evidence

The guarded reset was run twice successfully.

| Tenant | Students | Courses | Packages | Schedules | Memberships | Credit balance |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `lets-paint-showcase` | 12 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 78 |
| `lets-paint-studio` | 43 | 3 | 5 | 0 | 1 | 165 |

`lets-paint-studio` retained its pre-reset counts and balance. The showcase
also contains five enquiry states, three private portfolio works and six
metadata-sanitised display/thumbnail variants.

## 4. Verification evidence

### Repository and database gates

- `backend/tests`: **182 passed, 2 skipped**.
- Legacy CMS smoke: **73 passed, 0 failed**.
- PostgreSQL tenant isolation/privacy/Edition suite: **216 passed, 0 failed**.
- Migration check: current.
- Media derivative check: current.
- Python compile, inline scripts, shared JS, CMS source/build consistency, UI
  escaping, terminology and release/Edition shell syntax: passed.
- `STUDIOSAAS_REQUIRE_POSTGRES=1 bash backend/scripts/verify_local.sh`: passed.

### Browser acceptance

Real Chrome, no page errors and no HTTP 5xx:

| Surface | Viewport | Result |
|---|---:|---|
| Product home | 375×812 | no overflow; 44px actions; skip link; language switch; reduced motion; 125% text |
| Product home | 812×375 | no overflow |
| Product home | 768×1024 | no overflow |
| Product home | 1024×768 | no overflow |
| Product home | 1440×900 | no overflow |
| Studio Admin | 1024×900 | 8 industry cards + 8 operational starter-course summaries |
| Owner CMS | 768×1024 | no overflow; authenticated ICS download |
| Teacher CMS | 375×812 | three-step flow; no financial label; no schedule mutation |
| Family private area | 375×812 | balance 8, four attendance rows, one private work, native contact actions |

The post-release tunnel correction was also accepted in the in-app browser
against the public hostname. `/platform-admin` remained on the direct
application login, `/studio-admin` required an explicit slug without browser
storage fallback, `/cms` exposed an explicit tenant selector, and
`/lets-paint-showcase/studio-admin` locked the correct slug. The showcase CMS
rendered the Let's Paint Studio login and no tested page had horizontal
overflow.

Product-home display images are 760×760 WebP with intrinsic dimensions and
total **229,582 bytes** in the browser. Five role entrances render at every
tested viewport; local page load during the acceptance run was approximately
0.56 seconds.

The v8.0.1 product-home pass also verified the computed Navy hero, Warm Paper
canvas, accessible amber text, bilingual sales copy, every visible 44px target,
125% text and reduced-motion behavior. Measured contrast includes 17.90:1 for
white on Navy and 4.52:1 for amber text on Warm Paper.

The ICS response contains three recurring events, `TZID=Australia/Melbourne`,
stable weekly recurrence and no tested student name, mobile or family email.

### Migration artifacts

- `customer-resources/PWE_Studio_Data_Import_Template.csv`
- `customer-resources/PWE_Studio_Data_Import_Template.xlsx`

The XLSX contains Instructions, Students, Courses, Packages and Field Guide
sheets. All five sheets were rendered and visually inspected; ZIP integrity
and spreadsheet error-token scans passed.

## 5. Cloudflare operating truth

`START_STUDIOSAAS_ONLINE.command` now:

- pins `STUDIOSAAS_MODE=saas`;
- defaults the application runtime to port `8901`;
- reads the expected application version from `VERSION`;
- supports an explicit public base domain;
- treats `~/.cloudflared/config.yml` as the authoritative tunnel identity and
  ingress instead of selecting the first credential JSON file;
- waits for local and public health;
- runs `backend/scripts/verify_tunnel_parity.py` against deep health;
- refuses to call the tunnel accepted when version, mode, database or release
  identity differs.

Current observation on 2026-07-29:

- local and public deep health agree on
  `appVersion=8.0.1`, `mode=saas`, `db=ok`;
- DNS for `studiosaas.cc.cd` points to the controlled
  `studiosaas-v8-controlled` tunnel, whose ingress targets
  `http://localhost:8901`;
- the public platform-admin API returned all six local tenants;
- `lets-paint-showcase` owner authentication, tenant API and brand workspace
  all returned the exact showcase tenant;
- `/super-admin` remains a Cloudflare Access-protected compatibility alias;
  `/platform-admin` is the direct application-login route;
- the old tunnel was left intact but is no longer the hostname route, preserving
  rollback without allowing two runtimes to answer the same hostname.

The previous split-brain state is therefore resolved. Do not change the DNS
route back to the historical tunnel or start a second connector with a
different ingress for this hostname.

## 6. Packages and release closure

The clean-commit package gate passed for both delivery modes:

```bash
bash deploy/aws/verify_release_bundles.sh
```

Verified outputs:

- `dist/PWE-StudioSaaS-aws-8.0.1.tar.gz`
- `dist/PWE-Studio-Edition-8.0.1.tar.gz`
- matching `.sha256` sidecars.

The SaaS package includes the product gateway, customer resources,
professional showcase workspace/assets and guarded reset. The Edition package
excludes the showcase workspace and reset command while retaining the shared
runtime and customer/operator documentation. Both archives passed SHA-256,
entrypoint, forbidden-content and `BUILD_INFO` checks. The `.sha256` sidecars
generated from the final tagged commit are the authoritative hashes.

## 7. Operator commands

```bash
# Local service
bash START_STUDIOSAAS_LOCAL.command

# Guarded professional showcase reset
