## 7.5 v8.1.0 deployed — and the two defects the deploy itself exposed

`https://pwestudio.online` runs **v8.1.0**, image `studiosaas:8.1.0`,
commit `30da029`+, 21 migrations applied, plan quotas live at
`starter 100/1/2048 · studio 500/5/10240 · growth 1000/20/51200`.

Neither defect below was caught by a test. Both were caught by reading the
deploy output and probing the live edge afterwards, which is the argument for
doing that every time rather than trusting a green suite.

### The image tag named the wrong version

`docker-compose.yml` tags `studiosaas:${STUDIOSAAS_VERSION}`, and that variable
lives in `/opt/pwestudio/shared/production.env` — the file that deliberately
survives a release because it holds the secrets. Nothing updated it. Deploying
8.1.0 therefore built:

```
studiosaas:8.0.1     <- the tag
appVersion 8.1.0     <- what is actually inside it
```

Two consequences, both only felt during an incident: `docker images` lies to
whoever is diagnosing, and the tag stops being a rollback point because every
release overwrites the same one.

`pwestudio_remote.sh deploy` now reads the version out of the **bundle's own
BUILD_INFO** — not the laptop's `VERSION` file, which can already be ahead of
what is being deployed — and pins it before the rebuild.

### Renaming the release notes killed its public URL

`/customer-resources/Release_Notes_v8.0.1.html` returned 404 the moment the
file became `v8.1.0`. That URL is in sent mail, in the sales deck footer, and
in whatever a prospect bookmarked.

Any superseded versioned name now 301s to the current one. The pattern is
version-shaped (`Release_Notes_v\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.html`), so the next release
does not need this touched, and the traversal guard still runs first — the
redirect can only ever land on the allow-listed current file.

Verified live:

```
/customer-resources/Release_Notes_v8.0.1.html
  -> 301 https://pwestudio.online/customer-resources/Release_Notes_v8.1.0.html
```

### What v8.1.0 fixed in the product

The release's own reason for existing: **a studio's brand choice did not reach
every surface it was supposed to reach.**

- The CMS mapped 10 of 21 theme fields and forced its own background with
  `!important`. Every studio's CMS looked identical regardless of which of the
  eight palettes they chose. Portal, register and CMS now map the same 21
  fields, and a test asserts the three are equal **field for field** rather
  than each merely complete — so adding a token later fails on the first
  surface to adopt it, which is when drift begins.
- The registration success card paired a fixed `#EFE9DD` against
  `background:var(--ink)`. `--ink` is the tenant's `text_color`, so under the
  seven dark theme-modes it is LIGHT and that text measured **1.06:1** — the
  card a family sees after submitting an enrolment was invisible. It now pairs
  `--ink` with `--bg`, which `palette_gen.py:221` already asserts at 4.5:1 for
  all 15 theme-modes, and a second test guards that assertion itself.
- Focus ring was Family Amber at **1.70:1** on Warm Paper, under the 3:1 that
  WCAG 1.4.11 requires. Swapped to the accessible amber (4.52:1); the five
  navy-backed surfaces keep the bright amber at 9.70:1.

### Still open, deliberately

The CMS carries a second dark system in its `prefers-color-scheme` block that
still uses `!important`. Merging the two is item #29 of
`docs/design/UI_UX_Upgrade_Plan_2026-07-30.md`. A partial merge would leave
Tailwind surfaces dark while the page background followed a light tenant theme
— worse than either system alone. `test_portal_theme_contract.py` records the
gap so it cannot fade into the file, and fails when someone finishes it.

Also open from the same plan: items #7 and #8, the ~128 `text-gray-400` uses in
the CMS that measure 2.31–2.54:1. Monitoring, an SLA, privileged-account MFA
and off-box media backup remain absent and remain disclosed as absent.

## 7.6 Roster slots, and the CMS colour audit (2026-07-30, after the v8.1.0 deploy)

### Roster slots — migration 0022

The roster answered "who is coming today" but not "when". A studio running a
13:30 group and a 17:00 one-to-one saw one flat list, so the front desk could
not tell whether a student was due now or in four hours, and a one-to-one booked
into an occupied hour surfaced when both families arrived.

`daily_roster_entries` gains `class_time time` (NULLABLE) and
`one_to_one boolean`.

**`class_time` is nullable on purpose.** Every existing row predates the column
and there is no honest value to backfill; inventing 09:00 for 43 imported
students would look like data rather than the absence of it. The UI groups those
rows under 「时间未设置」 and sorts them last, keeping the gap visible.

**`time`, not `timestamptz`.** This is a wall-clock slot in the studio's own
timezone ("the 17:00 class"), not an instant. An instant moves when the offset
changes, which is exactly wrong for a recurring lesson.

Two semantics worth knowing:

- `POST /daily-roster` COALESCEs the slot, so re-adding a student without naming
  a time cannot erase one already set.
- `PATCH /daily-roster/<id>` is the correction path. Moving a student from 10:00
  to 17:00 must not reset their source and status the way re-adding would.

Nine isolation checks cover the round trip, the COALESCE, cross-tenant refusal,
and that `25:00` / `10:75` / `noon` / `10` are rejected while `""` remains a
legitimate way to say the slot is not decided.

The CMS shows a slot panel grouping the day by time, and flags what the flat
list hid: **a one-to-one sharing its slot with anyone else.** Rows carry an
inline time control, so a correction sits next to where the problem is visible.

### The CMS colour audit

`legacy-root/index.html` re-points Tailwind utility colours at the tenant theme.
It covered indigo and purple, shades 50/100/600/700 — correct for the shades
that existed when it was written, and silently rotten as the app grew.

Measured: **cms-app.jsx carries 1,322 colour utilities across 149
family+shade combinations in 12 families.** Two families were covered.

So a studio on the clay palette saw a green 「网站与品牌」 button, a blue
「长期未到访」 panel, green row actions, pink birthday chips, a purple-to-pink
report gradient and a stock-blue language switch. The CMS read as four products
stacked together — and the previous release, which themed the content area, made
it *more* conspicuous rather than less.

All 149 combinations now resolve to the theme, **mapped by role rather than by
hue**:

| Tailwind | Role | Resolves to |
|---|---|---|
| gray / slate / zinc / neutral / stone | structure | `--bg2`, `--line`, `--muted`, `--ink2`, `--ink` by shade band |
| green / emerald / teal / lime | success | `--success` |
| amber / yellow / orange | warning | `--warning` |
| red / rose | danger | `--danger` |
| blue / sky / cyan / pink / fuchsia | informational | `--accent-dark` |
| indigo / violet / purple | primary | `--accent` |

Role, not hue, because the role is what survives a palette change; and because
`palette_gen.py` already solves `--success` / `--warning` / `--danger` against
both page and panel for every theme-mode, routing through them inherits that
contrast instead of re-deriving it by eye. Soft fills use `color-mix` against
`--panel`, so they stay light under a light theme and dark under a dark one
rather than becoming a pale slab on a dark page.

Dark chrome (sidebar, mobile bar, login backdrop) maps to `--ink` with `--bg` as
the foreground — the inversion `palette_gen.py:221` guarantees at 4.5:1 — because
a fixed `text-white` is only readable while the surface stays dark.

`--brand` is now defined as `--accent`: the shared admin language switch reads
it, and with it undefined the switch fell back to stock blue `#3b82f6`.

**The test derives the required list from cms-app.jsx** rather than restating
it, so a newly-used shade fails the build at the moment it is introduced. That
matters more than this audit: the old rules were right when written and rotted
without a single failure.

### Also fixed

`backend/frontend/cms-entry.html` focus ring was `rgba(245,179,53,.55)`, which
composites to **1.40:1** on white — the translucency made it worse than the
solid amber, itself already too light for an indicator that WCAG 1.4.11 requires
at 3:1. Now the accessible amber at 4.92:1.

### Open

- The ICS export is **spec-invalid**: `DTSTART;TZID=Australia/Melbourne` with no
  `VTIMEZONE` component (`grep -c VTIMEZONE` = 0). RFC 5545 §3.6.5 requires the
  referenced timezone to be defined in the same calendar object; `X-WR-TIMEZONE`
  is an Apple extension and does not substitute. Apple leans on local time,
  Google is inconsistent, Outlook may refuse the import — so a class lands at
  the wrong moment in a family's calendar, silently, and `RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY`
  repeats it weekly. Being fixed in a separate stream together with the download
  dialog and the preview API shape.
- Still not done from `docs/design/UI_UX_Upgrade_Plan_2026-07-30.md`: per-day
  counts on the week strip, the inline status menu, the day's roster change log,
  item #29 (merging the two CMS dark systems), items #7/#8 (CMS-internal
  readability).

---

## 7.7 Calendar export: spec-invalid, and downloading as JSON

Two separate defects. Both are fixed; the second is the one the studio actually
hit.

### The file was spec-invalid

`DTSTART;TZID=Australia/Melbourne:...` with **no `VTIMEZONE` component** —
`grep -c VTIMEZONE` returned 0. RFC 5545 §3.6.5 requires the referenced timezone
to be defined in the same calendar object; `X-WR-TIMEZONE` is an Apple extension
and does not substitute. Apple leans on local time, Google is inconsistent,
Outlook may refuse the import — so a class lands at the wrong moment in a
family's calendar, silently, and `RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY` repeats that weekly.

`VTIMEZONE` is now derived from `zoneinfo`, not hard-coded, so a tenant in
Shanghai or London gets its own rules and abbreviations. Verified by parsing the
output back:

```
8月  DTSTART;TZID=Australia/Melbourne:20260805T160000  AEST +10:00 -> 06:00Z
11月 DTSTART;TZID=Australia/Melbourne:20261104T160000  AEDT +11:00 -> 05:00Z
```

The same "Wednesday 16:00" resolving to different UTC instants either side of
the transition is the proof the TZID is now honoured. Line folding was checked
at 75 **octets** against Chinese course names (3 bytes per character): 0 lines
over.

### The download was JSON

The control was `<a href="…calendar.ics" download>`. A plain navigation carries
no `X-Requested-With` header and is not a fetch, so the authenticated endpoint
answered **401 with a JSON body — and the browser saved that JSON as the
calendar file.** That is the garbled download the studio reported; it had
nothing to do with the ICS format.

Downloading from an authenticated endpoint requires a credentialed fetch and a
blob. The client now also refuses to hand the visitor a `.ics` whose
`Content-Type` is not a calendar, so this exact failure cannot recur silently.

### The dialog

Preview then download, both rendered from the **same `CalendarDocument`** the
`.ics` is serialized from, so the counts on screen cannot disagree with the file
that arrives. Shows event/class/one-to-one counts, each event with duration and
time range, the timezone with its abbreviations read from `zoneinfo`, anything
skipped and why, and Apple/Google import guidance.

Two honesty details: the dialog warns when a file **contains student names**
(it leaves the system and lives in someone's calendar), and it only claims the
file is a snapshot when `subscribable` is actually false.

Four endpoints: preview + `.ics` for the recurring schedule (no student data,
subscribable) and for a dated roster (student names, snapshot).

### The empty calendar and the wrong filename (2026-07-31)

The studio downloaded `~/Downloads/weekly-classes.ics`: 639 bytes, a valid
`VCALENDAR` with a correct `VTIMEZONE` — and **zero `VEVENT`s**. The dialog was
equally blank. Two independent causes, neither of them the ICS format:

1. **Every roster row predates migration 0022's `class_time` column.** The
   roster builder refused to invent a slot (correct — see the migration's own
   reasoning) and *skipped* those rows, so a studio that had not yet set any
   slot exported nothing. They are now exported as **all-day events**
   (`DTSTART;VALUE=DATE` / `DTEND;VALUE=DATE` on the next day, per RFC 5545),
   which asserts "expected today" and nothing about when. `skipped` is now only
   cancellations, reported by name. `test_roster_with_no_slots_set_still_
   exports_every_student` pins the whole path.
2. **The recurring-schedule export was genuinely empty** — Let's Paint Studio
   keeps no `class_schedules` rows, it works from the daily roster. That file
   was truthful; the *dialog* was the defect, saying nothing and still offering
   a download. The download button is now disabled at zero events and the empty
   state names the next action ("在「每周课表」新增班次后，这里就会有内容").

The filename was wrong because the client invented one. The server has always
put the correct name on the `CalendarDocument` (`<slug>-roster-<date>.ics`,
`<slug>-weekly-classes.ics`) and exposes it as `preview.filename`; `downloadIcs`
now uses that, falling back to `Content-Disposition` and only then to a literal.
A roster export saved as `weekly-classes.ics` was the visible symptom.

Skip reasons were also being rendered as raw machine codes (`no-class-time`);
they are now mapped to studio-facing Chinese with the student's name.

### CMS readability pass — the colour map was right, the contrast was not (2026-07-31, v8.1.1)

§7.6 mapped all 1,322 Tailwind colour utilities onto theme tokens by role. That
answered *which token does this colour come from*. It did not answer *can you
still read the text once both ends follow the theme* — a value can be perfectly
on-brand and invisible. Replaying every (text token x background token) pair the
CMS can produce against the 15 theme-modes in `backend/studiosaas/presets.py`
gave **197 failures in 645 pairs**. After this pass: **0 in 660**.

Every number below is the worst case across all 15 theme-modes, computed with
the same WCAG relative-luminance formula as `docs/design/palette_gen.py::ratio`,
and spot-checked against `getComputedStyle` in a real browser on both
`atelier-clay/light` and `arcade-lime/dark` (the model and the browser agree to
within 0.05).

| what | before | after | worst theme-mode |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| body text on a card (`bg-white` + `text-gray-900`) | **1.02** | **13.25** | arcade-lime/dark |
| soft text on a card | 1.40 | 9.67 | arcade-lime/dark |
| muted text on a card | 2.44 | 5.56 | arcade-lime/dark |
| white label on an accent fill | 2.08 | 5.83 | studio-ink/dark |
| label on a disabled primary button | 1.25 | 3.00 | rehearsal-rose/light |
| semantic text on its own soft fill | 3.15 | 5.57 | arcade-lime/dark |
| semantic text on `--bg2` | 2.86 | 5.00 | arcade-lime/dark |
| semantic text on `--panel` | 3.72 | 6.39 | arcade-lime/dark |
| `--muted` on the `bg-gray-200` chip | 4.17 | 4.56 | studio-ink/dark |
| the faintest text tier (`text-gray-300`) | 3.03 | 5.56 | all 15 |
| secondary accent text on `--bg2` | 4.44 | 4.72 | arcade-lime/dark |
| selected profile tab | 1.00 | 5.17 | atelier-clay/light |
| `--ink` on the page under OS dark + a light tenant theme | 1.16 | 14.57 | atelier-clay/light |

Four root causes, three of which are the same bug wearing different clothes —
`[class*="bg-red-50"]` is a substring test, so it also matches `bg-red-500` and
`active:bg-red-50`:

1. **`bg-white` (99 uses) and `text-white` (73) were never re-pointed.** They are
   not `<family>-<shade>` utilities, so the audit regex that produced the §7.6
   map never saw them. Under the eight dark theme-modes a card stayed `#ffffff`
   while its text became `--ink` — near-white on white, **1.02:1**. `bg-white`
   now resolves to `var(--panel)`; `bg-white/NN` is deliberately excluded because
   those sit on a `bg-black` scrim over a photograph.
2. **The `-500` solids were being caught by the `-50` soft fills.** The refund
   button, the low-balance badge and the portfolio delete button rendered as a
   12% tint under a white label. The 500s are now restated after the soft fills
   and each is paired with the on-colour the generator asserts.
3. **A `disabled:` / `active:` / `after:` prefix is invisible to `[class*=]`.**
   `disabled:bg-gray-300` sits on seven primary buttons (create class, join
   today's roster, save, top up) — they wore the disabled chip *at rest* under a
   white label, **1.25:1**. The disabled fill now binds to the real `:disabled`
   pseudo-class with the `--disabled-surface` / `--disabled-text` pair (3.00:1 —
   legible, deliberately under AA so it still *reads* as unavailable, which is
   also why it no longer needs the blanket opacity). A single guard keyed on the
   `:` that only a variant prefix can contain now stands down for `:hover` /
   `:active` / `:disabled` and nowhere else. Only those three prefixes are used
   with `bg-` in the whole file (126 `active:`, 7 `disabled:`, 4 `hover:`), so
   the guard cannot catch a responsive variant.
4. **Two dark systems were both in charge.** The `@media (prefers-color-scheme:
   dark)` block predates the role map and the role map outranks almost all of it
   by source order. *Almost*: `html`/`body`, the row hover and the input
   placeholder had no later counterpart, so under OS dark + a **light** tenant
   theme those three stayed dark while everything else followed the light theme.
   Rather than merge the two systems (plan item #29, still open), the outcome is
   scoped: once `/brand` answers, `data-brand-scheme` is on `<html>` and the
   tenant theme owns those three. Before it answers the OS block still prevents a
   white flash, which is the case it was written for.

**Semantic text now mixes toward an anchor rather than being used raw.**
`palette_gen.py:174` solves `--success`/`--warning`/`--danger` against the
**page** only, and `CHECKS` (`:231-233`) only asserts that. The CMS also puts
that text on `--panel`, on `--bg2` and on the role's own soft fill. The fix is
one ratio that works in both modes: `color-mix(in srgb, var(--ROLE) 61.8%,
var(--text-anchor))`, where `--text-anchor` is `--ink` on content surfaces and
flips to `--bg` inside the inverted chrome (sidebar, mobile top bar, bottom nav)
— declared as an inherited custom property, so a semantic colour dropped into the
sidebar later cannot darken itself into the surface. Measured in-browser on the
`#211B19` chrome: warning 6.16, success 6.06, muted 8.49. **68% is the exact AA
boundary; 61.8% is the golden section and buys 0.5 of margin for six points of
chroma.** The brand accents get the same treatment at a far lighter dose (94%),
enough to clear the single remaining miss without a perceptible hue change.

**The faintest text tier was deleted, not adjusted.** `text-gray-300` was
`color-mix(--muted 70%, --panel)` and measured 3.03:1 on `--panel` in *all 15*
theme-modes — necessarily, because `--muted` is already solved to sit on the AA
floor, so anything fainter is by construction below it. It now collapses into
`--muted`; hierarchy at that level has to come from size and weight.

#### Student profile: five tabs, three actions outside them

Grouped by *the question being answered*, not by field type: **概览** (who do I
call, when were they last here — what the front desk needs in five seconds),
**资料** (is the record correct), **记录** (what happened), **作品集** (what have
they made, and may we publish it), **专区** (can the parent log in — a different
audience). The publication-consent panel lives with the portfolio because consent
only ever means "may this piece go public"; splitting the two is what made the
old single column a wall of unrelated panels.

Three actions stay **outside** the tabs, in a sticky bar below the scroll:
加入今日排课 (performed many times a day), 快速充值 (what you reach for the moment
the balance badge reads low) and 编辑 (a mode switch that has to work from
whichever tab you are on). They used to be the *last* thing in the scroll, below
a portfolio grid and a consent panel. 归档学员 moved to the end of 资料 — a
lifecycle decision taken a few times a year that was sitting one thumb-width
below 生成成长报告. 生成成长报告 moved into 作品集, because it is assembled from
the portfolio.

The tabs implement the full WAI-ARIA tab pattern, not just `role="tab"`: roving
tabindex (exactly one tab stop), Left/Right with wrap, Home/End,
`aria-controls`/`aria-labelledby` both ways, `role="tabpanel"`. Verified by
driving the keyboard in a real browser. Same contract as
`backend/frontend/studio-admin.html`, so the two admin surfaces behave
identically. Targets are 44px and the strip scrolls rather than wrapping — a
wrapped tablist puts two rows of targets under a thumb aiming for one.

The selected-tab indicator is a real child element. Written as
`after:bg-indigo-600` it read to the override layer as `bg-indigo-600` and filled
the **button** with the accent under accent-coloured text: **1.00:1**. This was
caught in the browser, not in the model — the model does not know about variant
prefixes. It is the reason cause 3 above got a general guard rather than a
one-line patch.

#### Golden ratio, concretely

Every number comes from the φ ladder already in `assets/ui-tokens.css`
(5 · 8 · 13 · 21 · 34 · 55 · 89, each step ≈1.618x the last), so the sheet is
measured against the same scale as the dashboard:

- profile sheet width **34rem** (544px), height cap **89dvh**
- panel padding **21px** (`--ui-space-4`), row gap **13px**, action gap **8px**
- action bar columns **1.618fr : 1fr** — the primary action takes the golden
  major share, the secondary the minor; a lone action spans both rather than
  leaving a 38.2% hole
- semantic text mix **61.8% / 38.2%** role-to-anchor (AA boundary is 68%)
- row-hover fill **38.2%** of `--line` into `--panel`
- language switch inset **21px**, label **13px**

#### The two named controls

**中英切换 (bottom-right).** The control named in the brief was
`admin-i18n.js`, which reads `--brand`; the switch the CMS actually shows is
`cms-i18n.js`, and it was **fully hardcoded** — `#fff`, `#e2e8f0`, `#64748b`,
`#4f46e5`. Both are fixed. Every colour is now a token with the pre-theme palette
as fallback: surface `--panel`, hairline `--line` (1.34:1, floor 1.18), resting
label `--muted` on `--panel` **5.56:1** (the hardcoded `#64748b` measured
**3.06:1** once the panel followed a theme), selected label `--on-accent` on
`--accent` **5.83:1** (a fixed `#fff` on a bright dark-theme accent measured
2.08:1). The focus ring moved from `--brand`/`--accent` to **`--focus-ring`** —
`--accent` is solved as a *text* colour against the page, `--focus-ring` is the
one solved to clear 3:1 against every surface it can land on: measured 4.13 on
`--panel`, 3.60 on `--bg`, 3.22 on `--bg2`. Positionally it was sitting **on top
of the mobile bottom nav**; it now docks above it at the same 88px offset
`.toast-bottom` already uses, so the two agree about where the bottom of the page
is. Toasts still cover it briefly (z-index 999 vs 90), which is the correct order.

**左侧「网站与品牌」.** It was `bg-emerald-50/700`. Green was picked when the CMS
had no palette; once every colour maps by role it made an **outbound navigation
link read as a success state**. It and 公开网站 are a *pair of links out of the
CMS*, so the difference between them has to be hierarchy, not hue: editing the
brand is the accented action (`--tenant-primary` + `--on-accent`), viewing the
live site is the quiet read-only peer and keeps the chrome inset that 刷新 / 设置
already use. That contrast survives a palette change; green-vs-blue did not. The
same judgement is applied to the mobile settings sheet, where the list already
reads *filled = do it, soft accent = secondary, neutral = read-only, danger =
destructive* — 网站与品牌 takes the single filled slot.

#### Still open after this pass

- **Plan item #29 — merge the two CMS dark systems.** Scoped, not solved. The
  `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` block still carries ~60 hardcoded hexes
  for Tailwind surfaces. They are now unreachable on a themed page, i.e. dead
  weight that will mislead the next reader. `test_the_second_cms_dark_system_is_
  still_recorded_as_open` still guards it. **Risk: low** (dead code), **cleanup
  cost: a day**, because the whole Tailwind dark table has to be re-derived.
- **Pressed-state feedback is still flattened for ~53 of the 133 `active:bg-*`
  utilities.** The rest state is now correct everywhere, and `active:bg-gray-*`
  and `active:bg-indigo-*` were given explicit pressed fills, but families like
  `active:bg-amber-100` map to the same token as their resting fill, so the press
  is invisible on those. **Risk: low** — a missing affordance, not a contrast
  failure. The global `button:active` transform still fires.
- **The contrast audit is not a test.** The 660-pair sweep was run from a
  scratch script; nothing in `backend/tests/` will fail if someone re-introduces
  a `bg-white` or relaxes a mix ratio. `test_portal_theme_contract.py` still only
  checks that a *mapping exists*, not that it is *readable*. **Risk: medium —
  this is the most likely way the pass regresses.** Porting the sweep into
  `test_portal_theme_contract.py` is the highest-value follow-up.
- **`disabled:opacity-40/50` is still used on ~10 buttons.** Only the
  `disabled:bg-gray-*` path was moved onto the token pair; the opacity-only
  buttons still signal unavailability with transparency, which is the pattern
  `docs/Design_System.md:111-127` rules out. **Risk: low.**
- **Hardcoded hexes remain outside the override layer**: `.sl::-webkit-scrollbar-
  thumb` (`#c7d2fe`), `.pin-dot` / `.pin-input` (`#e5e7eb`, `#6366f1`), and
  `.img-skel`'s shimmer gradient. All are small, none carry text, none were
  measured. **Risk: low, cosmetic.**
- **The edit form inside the profile sheet was not restructured.** It is still
  one long column; only the read view was tabbed. **Risk: none** — it is a form,
  and a form is legitimately linear — but it is now visibly inconsistent with the
  read view beside it.
- **Not verified against a logged-in CMS.** Authenticating was out of scope, so
  the tab structure was verified by mounting the component in the real page and
  driving it, and the colour work by measuring `getComputedStyle` on synthesised
  class combinations. The *assembled* profile sheet with real student data has
  not been seen on screen. **Risk: medium for the tab layout specifically** — the
  contrast numbers do not depend on it, but a layout mistake inside a panel would
  not have been caught.

## 8. Customer-facing compliance pages and brand repair (2026-07-30)

### 8.1 What was wrong

The product gateway footer links two pages that the brand migration missed
entirely. `customer-resources/FAQ.html` and `Release_Notes_v8.0.1.html` still
declared the **retired** palette inline — forest `#15312e` on `#f7f3eb`, a sage
`#dce9df` note band, a `#d7a93d` focus ring.

Root cause of the miss: `backend/tests/test_product_home_brand.py:7` only ever
loaded `product-home.html`. Nothing in `customer-resources/` was inside the
regression net, so the two pages kept an obsolete palette without a single test
failing.

The FAQ was also **factually wrong after today's launch**. It answered "Is this
already a production AWS deployment?" with "No. The current service runs locally
… exposed through Cloudflare Tunnel. AWS hosting, production backups, restore
testing … are pending." All of that is stale as of §0.

### 8.2 What changed

- Both pages re-based on the canonical tokens through a shared
  `backend/frontend/assets/customer-resources.{css,js}`, so the next brand
  change touches one file rather than four.
- FAQ and release notes rewritten against the facts in §0. Deliberately **not**
  over-corrected: monitoring, an SLA, privileged-account MFA and off-box media
  backup are still absent and are still disclosed as absent.
- Two new compliance pages, bilingual on the same `data-lang` mechanism as the
  gateway:
  - `customer-resources/Privacy_Policy.html`
  - `customer-resources/Terms_of_Service.html`
- `product-home.html` footer links both; `backend/server.py` allow-lists both.

### 8.3 Legal identity (owner-supplied, 2026-07-30)

```
PWE GROUP PTY LTD
ABN 55 606 664 546        ACN 606 664 546
Caulfield North, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia
lee.liu.melbourne@gmail.com      Privacy contact: Lee L
Governing law: Victoria, Australia
```

The ABN checksum verifies (weighted sum 534, `534 mod 89 = 0`) and the ACN it
implies verifies independently (check digit 6). **Format and checksum only —
registration status was not looked up**, so neither page asserts more than the
identity itself.

### 8.4 Still open before these pages are relied on

| | Item | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 🟠 | Deliverable postal address | Suburb-level only. A privacy policy normally needs an address that can receive a written access/correction request. Nothing was invented. |
| 🟠 | Domain mailbox | `pwestudio.online` has **no MX record** — `info@` cannot receive mail, which is why the owner's Gmail is published instead. Move to `privacy@pwestudio.online` once MX exists. |
| 🔴 | Australian legal review | Two sections carry `Needs legal review` on the page itself: retention of children's teaching records, and how a deletion request interacts with record-keeping duties. The studios teach children; this is not a wording preference. |
| 🟠 | Liability and insurance | `Terms_of_Service.html:126` marks the cap, indirect-loss exclusion and insurance requirements as intentionally unresolved. |

Both pages carry a draft qualifier at the top, matching how
`docs/customer/Service_Agreement_Draft.md` positions itself.

### 8.5 The regression net that was missing

`backend/tests/test_customer_resources_brand.py` (new, 17 tests) now covers
**every** page in `customer-resources/`, not one hand-picked file:

- retired palette values fail the build; canonical tokens must be present
- no page may declare its own palette instead of reading the shared asset
- bilingual `data-lang` coverage, no leftover `{{PLACEHOLDER}}`
- legal entity present on the compliance pages, draft qualifier present
- the privacy policy must cover children and publication consent, must disclose
  the open gaps, and **must not promise a response deadline** while the
  contact channel is a personal mailbox
- the FAQ must state the live deployment, not the retired boundary
- Family Amber `#F5B335` may never be used as text on a light surface — that is
  what the accessible `#A16207` exists for
- the gateway footer must link every page, and `server.py` must allow-list every
  page shipped

Verification: **242 pytest** (was 206) + terminology, escaping and inline-script
checks all green.

### 8.6 UI/UX upgrade plan

`docs/design/UI_UX_Upgrade_Plan_2026-07-30.md` (1,593 lines) — analysis only,
no code changed by it. Highest-priority finding, which is a live defect rather
than a polish item: `tenant-template/index.html:265` `.result-card` hard-codes
`color:#EFE9DD` against `background:var(--ink)`. Under a light theme that is
13.69:1; under a dark theme `--ink` becomes the light text colour and the
registration success card renders at **1.06:1 — invisible**. The 56px check mark
sits at 1.21:1 and the "back to home" control at :538 has the same problem.

---

## 9. Commercial plan quota revision (2026-07-30, owner decision)

Quotas only. **Prices, plan codes, plan names and feature flags are unchanged**
(Starter 49 / Studio 99 / Growth 199 AUD per month; one-off Setup fee AUD
299–999 also unchanged).

| Plan | AUD/month | Students | Team users | Storage | `storage_limit_mb` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Starter | 49 (unchanged) | 100 (unchanged) | 2 → **1** | 5 GB → **2 GB** | 5120 → **2048** |
| Studio | 99 (unchanged) | 500 (unchanged) | 8 → **5** | 30 GB → **10 GB** | 30720 → **10240** |
| Growth | 199 (unchanged) | 1500 → **1000** | **20 (unchanged)** | 100 GB → **50 GB** | 102400 → **51200** |

`growth.user_limit` stays at **20**: the owner revised only Growth's storage
allowance and student ceiling and did not specify a team-account figure, so the
existing value was preserved rather than invented.

### 9.1 Files changed

Database / seeds:

- `backend/db/migrations/0021_plan_quota_revision.sql` — **new**, idempotent
  quota UPDATEs scoped by plan code (the pending production change, see §8.2).
- `backend/db/schema_v1.sql` and `backend/db/migrations/0001_schema_v1.sql` —
  baseline `INSERT INTO plans` seed rows carry the new quotas, so a fresh
  bootstrap is already correct and 0021 is a no-op there. Both stay in sync per
  the migration discipline.
- `backend/scripts/seed_local_test_tenants.py` — the isolation-fixture `studio`
  plan row now seeds `5, 10240`.
- `backend/test_tenant_isolation.py` — the storage-quota check restores
  `studio.storage_limit_mb` to `10240` instead of `30720` after temporarily
  forcing it to 1 MB.

No new tables, so `backend/studiosaas/services/tenant_archive.py`
`SNAPSHOT_TABLES` is **verified unchanged** — `plans` is a platform-global
table and was never a tenant-scoped snapshot member.

Customer-facing surfaces:

- `product-home.html` — the three public pricing cards, both `en` and `zh`
  spans (Starter "1 team user / 1 个团队账号" is singular).
- `docs/customer/Pricing_and_Package_Boundaries.md` — subscription catalogue.
- `docs/StudioSaaS_Blueprint_v2.md` — plan table.
- `docs/sales/PWE_Studio_销售介绍.pptx` (**current deck**, referenced by
  `README.md` and `docs/sales/talk_track.md`) and
  `docs/sales/PWE_StudioSaaS_销售介绍.pptx` (superseded earlier copy still in
  the repo) — slide 11 pricing table only. Both decks were rewritten
  part-by-part so that `ppt/slides/slide11.xml` is the **only** changed entry
  of 97; `scripts/office/validate.py --original` passes and a LibreOffice
  render of slide 11 before/after shows identical layout with no overflow.

Migration-inventory references bumped 0020 → 0021: `docs/Database.md` (with a
new 0021 paragraph), `docs/Architecture.md`, `docs/Development_Roadmap.md`,
`README.md`.

### 9.2 Production change — APPLIED 2026-07-30 (was: SQL only, not applied)

> **Superseded.** This section was written before the v8.1.0 deploy. Migration
> `0021` is now applied in production: 21 migrations recorded, quotas read
> `starter 100/1/2048 · studio 500/5/10240 · growth 1000/20/51200`. The
> procedure below is kept because it documents the two application paths and
> the reasoning; the "not applied" framing no longer describes reality. See
> §7.5 for the deploy that applied it.

`pwestudio.online` still holds the old catalogue. Editing the repository seed
does not touch a running database. Two ways in, neither performed here:

1. **Preferred — normal deploy.** `deploy/aws/entrypoint.sh` runs
   `scripts/run_migrations.py` with the owner role on every container start, so
   0021 applies by itself with the next
   `bash deploy/aws/pwestudio_remote.sh deploy <tarball>` once the bundle
   contains it. `schema_migrations` gains
   `0021_plan_quota_revision.sql` and the instance moves from 20 to 21 applied
   migrations (the §0 table still records the measured 20).
2. **Quota-only, without a redeploy.** Run the migration body by hand as the
   owner role, then insert the ledger row so the next deploy does not re-run it:

```sql
BEGIN;

UPDATE plans SET user_limit = 1, storage_limit_mb = 2048
 WHERE code = 'starter' AND (user_limit <> 1 OR storage_limit_mb <> 2048);

UPDATE plans SET user_limit = 5, storage_limit_mb = 10240
 WHERE code = 'studio' AND (user_limit <> 5 OR storage_limit_mb <> 10240);

UPDATE plans SET student_limit = 1000, storage_limit_mb = 51200
 WHERE code = 'growth' AND (student_limit <> 1000 OR storage_limit_mb <> 51200);

INSERT INTO schema_migrations (version)
VALUES ('0021_plan_quota_revision.sql')
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

COMMIT;
```

Verify afterwards:

```sql
SELECT code, monthly_price_aud, student_limit, user_limit, storage_limit_mb
  FROM plans WHERE code IN ('starter','studio','growth')
 ORDER BY monthly_price_aud;
-- expect: starter 49/100/1/2048, studio 99/500/5/10240, growth 199/1000/20/51200
```

### 9.3 Safety review of the reduction

1. **Over-quota behaviour is refuse-to-add, never delete.** Three enforcement
   points, all admission control on a *new* record:
   `api_v1._student_capacity` + its two call sites (student create, registration
   conversion) return 403 when `current >= student_limit`; the team
   create/reactivate paths return 403 when active non-`parent` memberships
   `>= user_limit`; `services/media._assert_storage_quota` raises
   `MediaQuotaExceededError` before an upload is written. Nothing archives,
   truncates or deletes existing students, members or media, so a tenant found
   above a lowered ceiling keeps all of its data and simply cannot grow until
   the plan is upgraded.
2. **`lets-play-piano` sits exactly at the new Starter ceiling** (1 of 1 team
   accounts). It keeps working; it cannot add a second account. The refusal
   text is explicit rather than a bare 403 body:
   `User limit reached (1). Upgrade the plan before adding another team member.`
   — plan name, the actual number and the required remedy. The student-side
   equivalents read `Student limit reached (N). Ask the StudioSaaS
   administrator to upgrade the plan.` and `… Upgrade the plan before
   converting this registration.`
3. **`isolation-no-portfolio` (price 1) exists in the production `plans`
   table.** It is the `backend/test_tenant_isolation.py` fixture plan
   (`500 / 8 / 1024 MB`, portfolio flag off) that leaked into the production
   database — reported, deliberately **not** deleted and deliberately **not**
   re-quoted by 0021, which is scoped to the three real plan codes. Cleaning it
   up is a separate decision because a tenant row may still reference it.

Known cosmetic non-issue, **not changed**: `super-admin.html
formatStorageMb()` prints one decimal below 10240 MB, so the Starter quota
renders as "2.0 GB" where the pricing page says "2 GB" (previously "5.0 GB"
vs "5 GB" — same pre-existing behaviour, not a regression). The decimal is
load-bearing for *used*-storage display, so the formatter was left alone. The
"Add Plan" form defaults (`149 / 800 / 12 / 51200`) describe a hypothetical new
custom plan, not Starter/Studio/Growth, and were also left alone.
## Appendix — v9.6.0 Studio Admin execution baseline

> 状态：执行基线（先交付 handoff，再进入 P0/P1/P2）；目标版本：`9.6.0`。
> 本 handoff 以当前源码、当前测试与生产状态为准；旧版本记录继续保留在本文档下方。

## 1. 当前事实与范围边界

- 当前源码分支：`codex/v9.3.0-cms-information-architecture`；生产已验证版本：`9.5.0`。
- 当前生产目标：`https://pwestudio.online`，部署方式使用仓库内的
  `deploy/aws/pwestudio_remote.sh` 控制器；发布前后必须分别验证 Source、Package、Production。
- Studio Admin 负责租户品牌、官网内容、报名入口、公开课表、预览、草稿和发布。
- CMS 负责学员、排课、签到、课时、报名审核和日常运营。
- 家长话术本轮**不迁移数据、不新建发送系统**：仍留在 Studio Admin，编辑入口移动到
  「招生入口」子菜单；实际复制和使用场景继续由 CMS 消费。
- 支付、银行转账信息、Gmail/SMTP、AWS SES、短信、SSE、WebSocket、浏览器 Push 均不在本版本。

## 2. 目标信息架构

Studio Admin 顶部只保留租户身份、查看官网、打开 CMS、语言和账户；工作台内部改为分组导航：

```text
品牌与官网
├── 品牌基础
├── 首屏与行动按钮
├── 官网版块
├── 工作室作品
└── 常见问答

招生入口
├── 报名表
├── 公开课表
└── 家长话术

发布中心
├── 草稿预览与发布
├── 历史版本
└── 页面健康

经营洞察
└── 官网数据分析
```

- 内部面板继续使用稳定的 `data-workbench-tab` 标识；新入口必须支持 URL deep link。
- 桌面保留编辑区与预览区约 `1.618:1` 的黄金分割；移动端转为单列，不依赖横向滚动标签。
- 家长话术仍进入现有 `messageTemplates` 载荷，保持旧租户数据兼容；本轮只做导航归类、说明和使用边界。

## 3. 执行队列

### P0：功能可信度

1. 补齐所有公开字段、课表开关、时区和家长话术输入的 dirty tracking，确保离开页面保护真实有效。
2. 修复顶部 Quick Registration 入口，使其能够打开隐藏的报名面板并保留当前草稿状态。

4. 修复 sticky 保存条的底部安全空间和遮挡关系。
5. 统一 workbench tab 的 URL 参数、浏览器前进/后退与首次载入行为。

### P1：信息架构与发布中心

1. 用分组侧栏替换十个平铺标签，家长话术放到「招生入口」子菜单。
2. 顶部低频操作收进账户菜单，减少跨层级重复入口。
3. 预览明确标注为草稿预览；“打开官网”明确表示已发布页面。
4. 发布中心展示「已发布 / 有未保存修改 / 草稿未发布 / 发布失败」四种状态。
5. 页面健康、历史版本和发布动作保持 Owner-only 权限边界。

### P2：交接质量与回归

1. 更新 Studio Admin、Owner、手册总览和 Release Notes 的当前版本说明。
2. 建立中英文、桌面/移动、键盘、脏状态、deep link、权限和租户隔离验收矩阵。
3. 构建生成资产，执行 PostgreSQL 完整门禁、浏览器验收、双模式打包和 checksum。
4. 只提交本版本相关的 tracked 文件；保留现有未跟踪的 `docs/sales/` 路演资料，不纳入提交与发布包。

## 4. 验收定义

- 任何可编辑字段改变后，状态都显示「有未保存修改」，刷新/离开会提示，保存后恢复干净。
- `?view=register`、`?view=messages`、`?view=advanced` 等关键入口可直接打开对应面板。
- 中文界面不会把 `Timetable` 作为主标签显示；英文界面仍保留自然英文。
- 桌面导航不再平铺十项；移动端无主内容横向滚动，主要按钮和输入框至少 44px。
- 家长话术仍可读取旧数据、恢复默认并进入现有发布载荷；没有第二个编辑器或新的发送服务。
- 草稿、预览、已发布官网三者在文案上不混淆；发布失败有明确恢复路径。
- 本地、包内和生产的 `APP_VERSION` / `BUILD_INFO` / deep health 均为 `9.6.0`。

## 5. 不在本轮解决的问题

- 家长话术独立迁移到 CMS、独立 API、Manager 自定义权限。
- 邮件、短信、Gmail/SMTP、AWS SES、在线支付和银行转账。
- SSE、WebSocket、浏览器 Push 或外部通知服务。
